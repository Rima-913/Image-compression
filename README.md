# Image-compression
## Description
This project presents a comparative analysis of two popular image compression techniquesâ€”Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The aim is to evaluate and contrast their performance based on quality metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Using 2D signals and standard compression procedures, we simulate both methods and analyze their effectiveness in retaining image quality post-compression.
## Objective
- Simulate DCT and DWT image compression techniques
- Compare quality of compressed images based on MSE and PSNR
- Analyze compression efficiency and visual fidelity

## Key concepts
- DCT: Transforms image to frequency domain; widely used in JPEG; energy compaction; suffers from block artifacts.
- DWT: Decomposes image into spatial-frequency subbands; better compression ratio; higher computational cost.
## Tools
- Python (NumPy, OpenCV, PyWavelets)
- Matplotlib(visualization)
- SciPy
